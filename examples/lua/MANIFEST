This directory contains some (academic) example applications, which make
use of certain Lua classes or modules in the padrinoma repository.  Try
to run the examples as

    texlua <example file>.lua --help

Example code documentation may be terse or non-existent.  Developers
should refer to API documentation of Lua (class) modules, which is
available in [LuaDoc][luadoc] format.

# `active_tries/`

Reads UTF-8 encoded strings from standard input and decomposes them into
Liang patterns.  Statistical data is collected about the number of
active tries per letter position.  Diagrams are created for all string
lengths as well as the complete list.

This is an application of intercepting the process of string
decomposition in class `cls_pdnm_pattern`.


# `patternize/`

Decomposes UTF-8 encoded strings from stdin into Liang patterns and
calculates spots indicating, e.g., valid hyphenation points. Results
(optionally with decomposition information) are written to stdout.

This is an application of intercepting the process of string
decomposition in class `cls_pdnm_spot`.


# `which_strings/`

Reads UTF-8 encoded strings from standard input and decomposes them into
Liang patterns.  For every pattern, all matching strings are recorded.

This is an application of intercepting the process of string
decomposition in class `cls_pdnm_pattern`.
