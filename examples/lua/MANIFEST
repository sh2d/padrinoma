This directory contains some (academic) example applications, which make
use of certain Lua classes or modules in the padrinoma repository.  Try
to run the examples as

    texlua <example file>.lua --help

Example code documentation may be terse or non-existent.  Developers
should refer to API documentation of Lua (class) modules, which is
available in [LuaDoc][luadoc] format.

# `active_tries/`

Reads-in a list of strings and decomposes them using Liang patterns.
Statistical data is collected about the number of active tries per
letter position.  Diagrams are created for all string lengths as well as
the complete list.

This is an application of intercepting the process of string
decomposition in class `cls_pdnm_pattern`.


# `debug_spots/`

Demonstrates the process of calculating spots within strings using Liang
patterns.

This is an application of intercepting the process of string
decomposition in class `cls_pdnm_spot`.


# `which_strings/`

Reads-in a list of strings and decomposes them using Liang patterns.
For every pattern, all matching strings are recorded.

This is an application of intercepting the process of string
decomposition in class `cls_pdnm_pattern`.
