# Installation

## Lua

To run any of the Lua examples in directory `examples/lua/` (see file
`MANIFEST` there), all Lua module and class files

    lua-classes/cls_pdnm_*.lua
    lua-modules/pdnm_*.lua

have to be placed somewhere the Lua interpreter can find them.  Proper
places can be determined for your Lua interpreter running the following
command:

    $ lua -e 'print((package.path:gsub(package.config:match(".-\n(.-)\n"), "\n")))'

See variable `package.path` [in the Lua reference
manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-package.path) for
more information.

The _slnunicode_ and _alt-getopt_ modules have to be installed.

When using the _texlua_ interpreter, the _kpathsea_ library is used to
find `require`d Lua modules.  Lua modules and classes can be copied to a
directory `scripts/padrinoma/` below your personal TEXMF tree, the
location of which can be determined running the command

    $ kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME

When placing the files in a shared TEXMF tree instead, such as
`TEXMFLOCAL`, you have to rebuild the file name database afterwards
(with adminstrator privileges):

    $ sudo mktexlsr

When the _kpathsea_ library is present in the Lua interpreter, most
examples accept short language codes for option `-p` when refering to
hyphenation pattern files installed in a TEXMF tree:

    -p en-gb    # vs.
    -p /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/txt/hyph-en-gb.pat.txt

Run examples with option `-h` for more information.


## LuaTeX

Additionally, before running any of the Lua(La)TeX examples in directory
`examples/luatex`, all files from directory `luatex/` (in the repository
root) have to be copied to a directory `/tex/luatex/padrinoma/` below
your TEXMF tree.



# Updates

If you observe strange errors while running the examples, e.g., after
pulling from the remote repository, remember to update the files in the
TEXMF tree.
