# Installation

To run the texlua and LuaLaTeX examples, some files from the repository
need to be copied to a local TEXMF tree:

    lua-classes/cls_pdnm_*.lua  =>  TEXMFHOME/scripts/padrinoma/
    lua-modules/pdnm_*.lua      =>  TEXMFHOME/scripts/padrinoma/
    luatex/*.sty                =>  TEXMFHOME/tex/luatex/padrinoma/

Finally, the TeX distribution's file name database needs to be updated
by running (with administrator privileges) a command, such as

    mktexlsr

After that, you're ready to run the examples.


# Updates

If you observe strange errors while running the examples, e.g., after
pulling from the remote repository, remember to update the files in the
local TEXMF tree.
