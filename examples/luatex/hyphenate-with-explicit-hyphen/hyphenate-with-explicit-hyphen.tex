This is an example application of the padrinoma package illustrating
automatic hyphenation of words containing a hyphen with Lua\TeX.  No
explicit hyphenation mark-up has been used in the source document.

In this example, word particles are hyphenated independently using
dedicated German compound word hyphenation patterns, read from file
\begin{center}
\verb+examples/patterns/hyph-de-1996-compound.pat.txt+
\end{center}
with inner word left and right hyphenation minima set to a value of~4.
If there are no such patterns available for your language, regular
hyphenation patterns can be used just as well.  But it is recommended to
set inner word hyphenation minima to a large value, \emph{e.g.},~8, in
that case.  Currently, these values are hard-coded, but they can be
adjusted in file
\begin{center}
\verb+pdnm_hyphenate-with_explicit-hyphen.lua+
\end{center}

See \texttt{log} file for a list of hyphenated German words containing
explicit hyphens.  Hyphenation results can be found after the colon in
lines starting \verb+[pdnm]+.  Hyphens in input are replaced by an equal
sign in output.  In the example \emph{Notaus-Schalter}, if inner word
hyphenation minima were set to smaller values, that would have been
hyphenated \emph{Not-aus=Schalter} as \emph{Notaus} itself is a compound
word and recognized as such by the given patterns.
