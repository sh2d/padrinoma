This directory contains some Lua(La)TeX example documents demonstrating
how to apply a particular pattern driven node list manipulation.

Example code documentation may be terse or non-existent.  Developers
should refer to API documentation of Lua (class) modules, which is
available in [LuaDoc][luadoc] format.
