This directory contains some (mostly simple) test applications.
Documentation may be terse or non-existent.

# `active_tries/`

An application of intercepting the process of string decomposition.
Reads-in a list of strings and decomposes them using Liang patterns.
Statistical data is collected about the number of active tries per
letter position.  Diagrams are created for all string lengths as well as
the complete list.


# `debug_spots/`

An application of intercepting the process of string decomposition.
Shows the process of calculating spots within strings using Liang
patterns.


# `which_strings/`

An application of intercepting the process of string decomposition.
Reads-in a list of strings and decomposes them using Liang patterns.
For every pattern, all matching strings are recorded.
