# Repository

The development repository is currently hosted at
[GitHub](https://github.com/sh2d/padrinoma/).  Bugs and a wish list can
be found in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/sh2d/padrinoma/issues/).

Main development languages are Lua and TeX.



# Code documentation

Lua code documentation is in
[LuaDoc](http://keplerproject.github.com/luadoc/) format and can be
generated via

    luadoc -d API *.lua



# Design decisions

## Lua and OOP

As far as Lua code makes use of the OOP paradigm, classes are derived
from a base class (module) `pdnm_cls_oop.lua`.  This class implements a
proto-type based OOP scheme following the approach presented in the book
<em>Programming in Lua</em> by R. Ierusalimschy, of which the first
edition is also <a
href='http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html/'>available online</a>.


## File names

Because this software is intended to be included into TeX distributions,
file names are an issue.  Where it seems appropriate, the prefix `pdnm`
is used as a pseudo name space in file names of this software.  As an
example, the Lua base class can be found in a file named
`cls_pdnm_oop.lua`.


## Call-back names

Call-back function names consist of an actual name and a prefix,
separated by two underscores.  The prefix starts with the string `cb_`
followed by a string refering to the class providing the call-back.

As an example, class `cls_pdnm_pattern` provides a call-back
`cb_pdnm_pattern__decomposition_start`.
