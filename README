### Meta information

Summary description: The padrinoma package provides means to apply
pattern driven node list manipulations in the LuaTeX typesetting system.
Such low-level operations can be used to handle certain typographic
features that involve glyph replacements, such as non-standard
hyphenation or smart ligaturing.  Technically, this is an application of
[Liang's hyphenation algorithm](http://tug.org/docs/liang/).
