### Meta information

Summary description: The padrinoma package provides means to address
typographical problems that are structurally equivalent to hyphenation,
e.g., non-standard hyphenation or smart ligaturing.  In the LuaTeX
typesetting system, such problems can be tackled by node list
manipulations.  This package provides a Lua implementation of
[Liang's pattern matching algorithm](http://tug.org/docs/liang/) and
some managing code to support the application of pattern driven node
list manipulations in LuaTeX.
